# About This Repository

This repository contains only the `Source/` folder of a larger Unreal Engine 5 **WIP** project. Please ignore the placeholder `PristsWithGuns` name... I created the project with a different idea in mind ðŸ™ƒ

Due to GitHub size limitations, Iâ€™ve chosen to upload only the source code to showcase my programming and gameplay systems. I have been using `Diversion` instead of git on my end for complete version control.

This repository is intended for portfolio purposes and to show my current C++ coding style, architecture decisions, and Unreal Engine programming skills.

If you wish to learn more about the project and see it in action, check it out on my portfolio: https://grfigueira.github.io/projects/7thFloor

## Additional Information

I am using:
- Unreal Engine 5.5
- FMOD for the audio
- The entire game is programmed in C++, except for a few simple delegate handlings that I'm doing in the level blueprint.
