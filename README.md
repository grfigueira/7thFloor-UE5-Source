# About This Repository

This repository contains only the `Source/` folder of a larger Unreal Engine 5 **WIP** project. 

Due to GitHub size limitations and the fact that most of the project's size comes from non-code assets (e.g., `Content/` and `Plugins/`), Iâ€™ve chosen to upload only the source code to showcase my programming and gameplay systems.

This setup is intended for portfolio purposes and to give some insight into my current C++ coding style, architecture decisions, and Unreal Engine programming skills.

If you wish to learn more about the project and see it in action, check it out on my portfolio: https://grfigueira.github.io/projects/7thFloor
